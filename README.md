# Prism Camera

PrismCamera is a basic camera app that processes the input image to create a double-vision effect.




## Tecnology
The camera was set up and built with AVFoundation, while the image-processing was handled with Core Image. The camera preview layer was developed partially with UIKit, the access to the last taken picture is handled with Photos framework, while the user interface was developed with Swift UI.

Made with Swift Playgrounds.
